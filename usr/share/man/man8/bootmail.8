.SH NAME
bootmail - email a list of address a signed message of logs when this system (re)boots

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbootmail\fP is a program called at reboot by \fBcron\fP(8), perhaps useful for unattended, remote servers.

It will read a list of one or more comma-separated email addresses from \fI/etc/bootmail/recipients\fP, and then loop over a list of white-space separated files in \fI/etc/bootmail/logs\fP, and construct an email.

By default, the email will at least consist of the hostname of the system, the time and date of the boot, as well as the contents of \fI/var/log/boot.log\fP and \fI/etc/motd\fP.

\fBbootmail\fP will also cryptographically sign the email message using \fBrootsign\fP(1) and \fBgpg\fP(1).  To verify the signature, you will need to \fBgpg --import\fP the public key stored in \fI/etc/rootsign.pub\fP.
